# 2024 Project Tracker

## About The Project
The purpose of building this project is to keep myself motivated towards the goals that I have set for 2024. I track my goals, habits, and thoughts using Google Forms and realized that looking at the Spreadsheet is going to kill my motivation whenever I recollect, strategize, and plan for my goals.

I've decided to create this React project for that purpose. As a side goal, I've decided to use different library dependencies and packages for this project to get exposed to other technologies that I do not use and get used to them.

## Built With
[React](https://react.dev/)

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

[SheetDB.io](https://sheetdb.io/)

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

[GitHub](https://github.com/)

[Google Spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)

## Usage
This project can be used to fetch data from your own personal Google Spreadsheet. You just have to set your own .env variables with the same columns that I used in each card if you like. 

## Roadmap
The **first step** that I did with this project is to plan and decide what tools and frameworks I will be using for this project. I've been using Next.JS recently so for a change, I decided to use Vite to learn more about it and how it works with the simple CI/CD I developed through GitHub Actions. For the design and components, I used shadcn/ui to expand my tools of component libraries.

The **second step** is code and develop. This is where my leniency got the best of me. I've been developing in a Test-Driven Development and have been setting up CI/CD for each of the repositories that I work on. For this project, I decided to develop all of my code on `master` branch thinking that it would be a quick and simple project. **ROOKIE MISTAKE**. Turns out, there was a lot of *unknown unknowns* that I did not prepare for which led to poor development experience.

### Challenges

The challenge that I struggled with is fetching the data from the Google Spreadsheet. I was trying to implement the fetching feature using [google-spreadsheet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-spreadsheet) package, but failed to do so. I struggled for a day or two. Having this roadblock made me ponder of creating a backend, but that will be way out of scope for this project. After more research, I found SheetDB.io which saved me ton of time.

### Improvements

As a personal note, I told myself to keep continuing the CI/CD pipeline, tasking out tasks, and TDD practice that I've been doing until now NO MATTER HOW BIG OR HOW SMALL I think the project is.
